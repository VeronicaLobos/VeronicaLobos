Hi there, I'm a 37yo originally from Spain. I have experienced different cultural backgrounds and worked in a range of fields,
which has allowed me to gain perspective, value contrast, and, in general, become a flexible person adapted to change.

Since the arrival of AI and the global pandemic, I found out that I needed to move on to a field where I could deploy all the skills, knowledge, and experience I've gained while I keep learning. I found myself having fun while coding and I can also be quite creative with it.
